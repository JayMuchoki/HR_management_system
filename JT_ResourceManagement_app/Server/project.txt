This part of your code defines a route handler on the server side using Express.js. Let's break down what this code does:

javascript
Copy code
router.post('/adminlogin', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
});
Explanation:
router.post('/adminlogin', ...):

This defines a route that listens for POST requests at the /adminlogin endpoint. When a POST request is made to /adminlogin, the function you provide (the callback function) will be executed.
Callback Function (req, res) => { ... }:

This is the function that will run when a POST request is received at /adminlogin.
console.log(req.body);:

This line logs the body of the request to the console. The req.body contains the data that was sent in the POST request. This is typically the form data submitted by the client (in this case, the data sent by the Axios POST request from your handlesubmit function).
